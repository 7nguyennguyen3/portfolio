**Last Updated:** December 16, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Ember** ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles your data and assures you that we do not collect personal information for our own use.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

### Personal Data

The Ember application **does not** require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal contact information (such as your name, email address, or phone number). All core functionality, including focus timers and challenge tracking, runs locally on your device.

### Financial Data & In-App Purchases

Our application offers optional in-app purchases (such as visual themes) to enhance your experience. We use **RevenueCat** to manage these transactions in conjunction with the **Google Play Store**.

While we do not store your credit card or banking details, RevenueCat and Google Play collect the following data to process your purchase and unlock features:

- **Purchase History:** To validate receipts, restore purchases if you reinstall the app, and provide us with anonymous sales analytics.

## 3. Third-Party Service Providers

We use the following third-party services to ensure the app functions correctly. These providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they handle data:

- **RevenueCat:** Used for managing in-app subscription and purchase infrastructure.
  - [RevenueCat Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)
- **Google Play Services:** Used for processing payments and distributing the app.
  - [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## 4. Data Safety (Google Play Disclosure)

In compliance with Google Play's Data Safety standards, we disclose that **Purchase History** is collected by our service provider (RevenueCat) for the purposes of **App Functionality** and **Analytics**. This data is encrypted in transit.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Our application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13.
